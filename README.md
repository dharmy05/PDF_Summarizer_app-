Got it ðŸ™‚ â€” hereâ€™s a more **human-sounding README** you can use instead of the structured one. Itâ€™s still clear and helpful, but feels like a person wrote it for other devs:

# ðŸ“„ PDF Summarizer

This is a small PHP app that lets you upload a PDF and get a quick summary of its contents.  
It uses [smalot/pdfparser](https://github.com/smalot/pdfparser) to pull text out of the PDF, and then summarizes it either with the **OpenAI API** (if you have a key set up) or with a simple built-in summarizer if you donâ€™t.

---

## What it can do

- Upload a PDF through a clean, Bootstrap-styled form
- Extract the text and show a summary in seconds
- Use OpenAI (better results) if youâ€™ve set your API key
- Or fall back to a keyword-based summarizer if you havenâ€™t
- Lets you upload another PDF without refreshing manually

---

## How itâ€™s set up

```

pdf_summarizer/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.php        # Upload form
â”œâ”€â”€ process.php      # Handles upload + shows summary
â”œâ”€â”€ summarizer.php   # Summarization logic
â”œâ”€â”€ uploads/         # Where uploaded PDFs go (empty at first)
â”œâ”€â”€ vendor/          # Composer packages
â”œâ”€â”€ .env             # Your API key lives here (not committed)
â”œâ”€â”€ .env.example     # Example env file to share
â””â”€â”€ README.md

## Getting started

1. Clone the repo and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pdf_summarizer.git
   cd pdf_summarizer
   composer install
````

2. Copy the example env file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Open `.env` and put in your OpenAI API key:

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
   ```

4. Fire up a PHP server:

   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser and try uploading a PDF.

## A note on the API key

* If youâ€™ve set an `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your `.env`, the app will call OpenAI for summaries.
* If not, it will just use the fallback summarizer, which works fine for testing but is less smart.
* The `.env` file is ignored by Git, so your secret key never ends up in commits.

---

## Future ideas

Thereâ€™s plenty of room to improve this little project. A few ideas:

* Let users download the summary as a text file
* Handle multiple PDFs at once
* Keep a history of uploads and summaries
* Add export to Word/Markdown
* Maybe even a login system for multi-user use
